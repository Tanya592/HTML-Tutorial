Subject: Awareness of the increase in the environmental pollution in the area

 

Respected Sir/Madam,

My name is Priyanka, and I work for the NGO SEVA. I’m writing to draw your attention to the growing impact of environmental degradation in our neighbourhood and the surrounding area. I would like to raise the kind attention of the concerned authorities to environmental awareness through the editorial column of your renowned newspaper.

The use of private transportation in Delhi has increased rapidly, as has the number of industrial sectors that have emerged in recent years. This has increased the likelihood of major health concerns such as breathing difficulties, chronic diseases, lung damage, nausea, exhaustion, and so on. Unfortunately, man has been harming his own benefactors in his ignorance thus far. Our government has just recently become aware of the depth of the situation. Scientists are working on ways to reduce the impact of the smoke emitted by our automobiles and chimneys. Indeed, environmental awareness is a social requirement. It is not just the government’s job, but also every individual’s social responsibility, to assist maintain the environment clean.

Because of the gravity of the situation, I respectfully request that you draw attention to it so that action can be made to reduce the impact of environmental pollution and the risk of people being affected by it.

 

Thanking you,

Yours sincerely,

Signature

Priyanka Dsouza

Member of NGO SEVA
